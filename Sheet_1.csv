Another person I hadnt been friends with for years cause of some stuff called me out of the blue on thankgiving last year. I called back and got a hospital number so I knew something was up. Ended up being a kid who I was friends with years before but was a huge douche to me. He was in the psych ward for trying to kill himself. I got a hold of him and talked to him for a while. Whenever he would call I would answer and be there even though I still had the shit from years earlier on my mind.

Basically treat other humans even strangers with the respect and kindness of a friend. That's all people need sometime. Let people talk through their shit with me and offer helpful advice if I can.

But how i helped was by basically talking to her, and giving her the advice she needed to hear, not the one she wanted to such as oh you'll be ok  this will all blow over"" what i said was more along the lines of being so blunt that many may find it rude but for her and i it was essential to making any progress.""""y friend dealt with anxiety and this desire for everything in her life to be perfect  she describes it as caring what happens to much  but either way I simply talked to her and when """,,,,,
