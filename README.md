# NLP-Classification-for-Text

we have 2 files sheet 1 & sheet 2

sheet 1 contain 80 replies from users to chatbot , & it either classied as offensive (flagged) or non-offensive (not flagged)

and sheet 2 contain 125 resumes , some of them looks unreal so it flagged & some are real : not flagged

we need to use NLP techniques to train our model , so he can be able to diffrentiate between them
